# X-RayCalc 2

X-RayCalc 2
X-Ray Calc 2 is a revside version of software for computer simulation of X-ray reflectivity, including normal incidence and grazing incidence X-ray reflectometry (NIXR and GIXR).
In this version, the automatic optimization based on modified LFPSO algorithm was implemented (see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10066334/ for further details).

The X-Ray Calc distribution contents several demonstration projects located in the Examples folder To see the demos, click the Open button, navigate to the Examples folder, and select a project file.
